# Android App for making and viewing virtual exhibitions
This application made with Java in Android Studio, it's my first Android project.
With this app you can create "exhibitions": full-screen images with points on them, tap one of points and you will see information (few different layouts can be used), which can include rich text, images, audio or video.

This is not only for exhibitions in the literal sense of the word (not only museum kind), you can make family album, show your goods, make some map - many different stuff, anything with fullscreen image at the base.

You're absolutelly free to use it as you want, make any changes and add issues, but don't forget it's my first Android app, so its code may be a total mess.

## Currently in development 

## Idea (pre-development)
I have few old cheap tablets at my current workplace and think it would be nice to give them second life. So I wanted to make exibition viewer for them, something very simple and universal, that any non-technical person can use later and supply with a new content.

It's not VR or 3D Panorama, because from my experience it's not what people need in everyday use. Usually we need "tap this point -> read about it" programm and that's it. 

Also important thing - end-point user (not developer and content-manager) shouldn't be able to close it or make some harm.

Tho not just one exhibition, but editor to make any kind of exhibitions and fill them with different content.
Exhibition creating with this editor must be so easy that any user without technical knowledge can do it.

## While now it supports these types of content:
* 2 layouts of text content (some html tags allowed)
* 3 layouts of text and image content
* audio 
* video

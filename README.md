# Android App for making and viewing virtual exhibitions
This application made with Java in Android Studio, it's my first Android project.

## Currently in development 

## Idea (pre-development)
![my_image_1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hexronimo/exhibition/master/idea.jpg)
I have few old cheap tablets at my current workplace and think it would be nice to give them second life. So I wanted to make exibition viewer for them, something very simple and universal, that any non-technical person can use later and supply with a new content.
It's not VR or 3D Panorama, because from my experience it's not what people need in everyday use. Usually we need "tap this point -> read about it" programm and that's it. 
Also important thing - end-point user (not developer and content-manager) shouldn't be able to close it or make some harm. 

## Here will be photos from real usage
